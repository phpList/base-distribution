## About phpList

phpList is an open source newsletter manager. This project is a rewrite of the
[original phpList](https://github.com/phpList/phplist3).


## About this package

This module is the basis for a phpList 4 installation. It will pull in the
`phplist/phplist4-core` module (the phpList 4 core), by default also the
`phplist/rest-api` module (the new REST API package) and (in the future) the
`phplist/web-frontend` module (all via Composer). Both dependencies are
optional.

This package is intended to be cloned and then modified. It is not intended to
be updated via Composer after the initial install (although updating the
dependencies via composer update is fine).

This (i.e., the downloaded package) is also the place where configuration files
will be stored (or symlinked to).


## Installation

1. Download and install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
2. Run `composer create-project phplist/base-distribution your-project`
   (use any name you like fot the `your-project` directory).
3. Switch to the `your-project` directory.
4. If you would like to not have the web front end or the REST API, edit the
   `composer.json`, remove the corresponding `phplist/phplist/web-frontend` or
   `phplist/rest-api` requirement, and run `composer update`.
